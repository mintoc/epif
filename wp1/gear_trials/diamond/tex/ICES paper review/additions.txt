The total weight per cod-end covariate deserves special attention as it may requires different treatment to variables such as the case-specific variables such as carapace length. For a given length-class and haul, the carapace length is common across the four cod-ends, whereas the catch-weight varies across the cod-ends W_(h,j)..  Such “Cod-end bulk weights vary by cod-end W_(i,k)  and can thus be considered a choice-specific attributes. cChoice-specific” variables in a multinomial setting are typically modelled as using conditional logit models (McFadden, 1973), which remove the subscript jk from the parameter for that covariate, thus in a strict conditional model for weight the weight effect would beis W_(h,j) ?W_i ? so at equal weights in the cod-end the effect is cancelled. Cod-end weight influences the opening angle of the meshes and it is doubtful that the effect of weight should be common across cod-ends (e.g., a 70mm mesh might stretch less/more for a given cod-end weight than a 100mm), we therefore allowed the effect of weight to differ by cod-end W_(h,j) ?_j.

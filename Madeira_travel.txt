Flights: 
Hotel:

Thanks very much for the monkfish, we seared it, roasted it and had it with a potato hash (Rick Stein http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/8637397/Rick-Steins-roasted-monkfish-with-crushed-potatoes-olive-oil-and-watercress-recipe.html). Substituted spinach for the watercress.
